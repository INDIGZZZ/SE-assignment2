📋 6.2 Create GitHub Issues

In your repository, click the Issues tab → New issue.

Create two issues:

Issue #1: “Add user input feature” → assign to yourself.

Issue #2: “Update README with final instructions” → assign to a classmate or teammate (if none, you can assign yourself again).

Add a short description for each.

After completing each task, go back to the issue → click Close issue.
